        <p>I grew up in Northern California in a city called Chico. From an early age I loved music and started playing the trumpet when I was 7. My enjoyment of performing grew and I decided to pursue music as a career. I moved to Chicago to pursue a BM in French horn performance at Roosevelt University. Following my graduation, I won a job in Mexico and moved there and stayed there for a few years. It was there that I met the horn teacher at University of Miami. He offered me a spot in his program and a great scholarship and I've been in Miami playing horn and enjoying being a part of the dynamic freelance scene ever since.</p>

        <p>Now i'm ready to try something new! I have spent most of my life blowing through a tiny metal hole but I am ready to learn a new and more practical skill, and have fun doing it. I have found this journey already super interesting and exciting and I can't wait to see where this new path takes me. I go forward bravely and with enthusiasm :)</p>
