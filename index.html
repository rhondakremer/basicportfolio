        <p>I grew up in Northern California in a city called Chico. From an early age I loved music and started playing the trumpet when I was 7. My enjoyment of performing grew and I eventually moved to Chicago to pursue a BM in French horn performance. Following my graduation, I won a job in Mexico and stayed there for a few years, and is where I met the horn teacher at University of Miami. He offered me a spot in his program and I've been in Miami playing horn ever since.</p>

        <p>Now i'm ready to try something new! I have found this journey already super interesting and exciting and I can't wait to see where this new path takes me. I go forward bravely and with enthusiasm :)</p>
